# SteamCMD in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install Palworld and run it.

**Server Name:** Palworld Docker  
**Password:** Docker  
**Admin Password:** adminDocker  

**Configuration:** The configuration is located at: .../Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini  

ATTENTION: First Startup can take very long since it downloads the gameserver files!

Update Notice: Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.

You can also run multiple servers with only one SteamCMD directory!

## Example Env params

| --- | --- | --- |
| STEAMCMD_DIR | Folder for SteamCMD | /serverdata/steamcmd |
| SERVER_DIR | Folder for gamefile | /serverdata/serverfiles |
| GAME_ID | The GAME_ID that the container downloads at startup. If you want to install a static or beta version of the game change the value to: '2394010 -beta YOURBRANCH' (without quotes, replace YOURBRANCH with the branch or version you want to install). | 2394010 |
